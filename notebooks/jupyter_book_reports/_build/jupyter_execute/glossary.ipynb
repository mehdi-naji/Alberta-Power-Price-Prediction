    "**System marginal price** -  The price at which electricity supply is dispatched to meet the demand on the grid. In the Alberta energy market, the SMP is determined every minute and represents the cost of producing an additional unit of electricity at a specific time. The average of SMP for an hour is the **Pool price**.\n",
    "\n",
    " Due to the erratic nature of receiving System Marginal Price (SMP) data through the API, we may not have access to SMP values for every hour. To address this, we have implemented an averaging method where we calculate the average SMP value for each hour. We also have the sum of SMP values for each hour"
